## Director of Operations, Hacks/Hackers

Hacks/Hackers is hiring a Director of Operations to oversee our HR, finance and administrative responsibilities. 

We will pay you competitively, let you work flexible hours from wherever you want, send you to interesting places for events, encourage you to shape 30% of your role, and take your ideas seriously. Join us!

Expected salary: $80,000 - $100,000. While the below responsibilities are not a full time role, we have budget to expand to full time with additional responsibilities such as programming and fundraising support, depending on candidate preferences. 


## About Hacks/Hackers

Hacks/Hackers is a global network of local grassroots organizations, and a community of journalists and technologists who collaborate to create physical and digital community to explore new ways to tell stories. 

Since 2015, Hacks/Hackers has also incubated a number of projects in the misinformation space, including one which just received a $5 million two-year contract from the National Science Foundation and will require competent financial and operational oversight, which is why we need to bring in a Director of Operations who has experience overseeing government awards or, at least, loves the idea of digging into the Federal Acquisitions Regulations. 

We believe the open flow of quality information is essential to democratic society, and seek to ensure that the watchdog function journalists have fulfilled continues to exist, regardless of the institutions that have played that role in the past.

In addition to countless local meet ups, our event programming includes a number of larger scale conferences around misinformation, like the [Buenos Aires Media Party](https://www.mediaparty.info), [MisinfoCon](https://misinfocon.com/), [WikiCredCon](https://www.wikicred.org/), the [Conference for Truth and Trust Online](https://truthandtrustonline.com/), and the [Misinformation Village](https://defcon.misinfocon.com/) at DEFCON.  


## About the Role

The Director of Operations will manage an administrative assistant and have final oversight for financial management, including Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable, and will be responsible for contracts, grant and budget management, subcontract administration and human resources management. The Director of Operations supports the [Hacks/Hackers Board of Directors](https://www.hackshackers.com/about/organizers/) in gathering materials for fundraising efforts.

This is a remote position. 


## About You



* You‚Äôre an experienced operations professional with a passion for helping lean, mission-driven organizations grow effectively.
* You have had experience with non-profit finance: you know the difference between restricted, temporarily restricted and unrestricted funding; and you know your way around a 990. 
* You have experience with federal contracts, or at least know enough to know what you don‚Äôt know and the willingness to do the work to find answers. 
* You enjoy a nimble and dynamic work environment without many layers of decision-making or ‚Äúbuy-in.‚Äù
* You can be self-directed in a remote environment. We don‚Äôt expect you to be at your computer all day, but we do expect you to be communicative and be up for air every weekday to engage on more pressing matters. 
* You get things done and solve problems ‚Äì you aren‚Äôt someone who looks away and hopes that someone else will fix it. 
* You appreciate high-competency, low-drama work environments, and want to cultivate a culture that fosters that ethos. 
* You know how to stay in the rules, but also have mastered the rules well enough to be creative within the rules to get the job done. 
* You are experienced with the administrative end of Quickbooks, Expensify, Slack, Airtable, Gmail and other cloud-based contemporary tools. 
* You have a solid grounding in the basic tools and systems needed to run a company ‚Äî spreadsheets, invoicing, expensing, file sharing, etc.
* It brings you genuine joy to see your books reconciliation come back at $0.00 (or it makes you at least a little happy)
* You‚Äôre detail-oriented, nothing gets past you. You notice errant hyphens, unruly cells in spreadsheets and inconsistent contract clauses. (You don‚Äôt have to be superhuman, but this job does require a lot of attention to detail.)
* You have common sense and a spidey sense when an email looks like one of the many phishing scams targeting non-profits. 
* You are willing to learn new things as needs arise or as our organization finds itself on adventures. 

_Pluses_



* You have an eclectic range of skills. Our organization attracts people who have done many different things and we always appreciate people who can jump in to help. This could include graphic design, copyediting, video production, Google AdWords, website design, event management, fundraising, and partnership development. 
* You know people who know people. We often need to pull in some help across various geographies or fields, and it‚Äôs nice to have existing relationships. 
* You love and appreciate events and have an aesthetic instinct for producing or supporting conferences. 
* You are eager to work with grassroots organizations across different continents.
