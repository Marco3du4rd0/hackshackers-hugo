Welcome to another week, hacks and hackers! Bellingcat is conducting a survey to find out more about which open source tools journalists are currently using so they can better know what kinds of tools to develop moving forward.

The survey takes about 10 minutes to respond, and two respondents will receive a free online Bellingcat workshop for their time.

* Nieman Lab compiled a [list of resources for following the Russia/Ukraine situation](https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/02/follow-war-ukraine/) as it unfolds, including Twitter accounts, live streams, maps and more.
* With rapid innovation in mapping technology, it can be hard to keep up with which tools are the best and most current, so GIJN compiled a list of [nine essential mapping tools for journalism in 2022](https://gijn.org/2022/02/17/9-essential-mapping-tools-for-journalists-in-2022/) for those wanting to incorporate maps into their work.
* Data literacy is becoming more essential in jobs across disciplines, and this article from Nightingale talks about [the benefits of merging data literacy with the general education curriculum](https://nightingaledvs.com/data-literacy-and-general-education-a-potentially-perfect-partnership/) to better prepare the upcoming generations.
