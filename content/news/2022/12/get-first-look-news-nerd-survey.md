Over 600 journalists participated in [Open News’ 2022 News Nerd Survey](https://opennews.org/what/community/survey/), which looks at how the community of news developers, designers, editors, data analysts and product folks is faring. Though the full results will be released sometime in 2023, Open News compiled [some early takeaways from the survey results](https://opennews.org/blog/survey-first-look/).

The European Journalism Centre is also collecting insights on the community in [its State of Data Journalism Survey](https://datajournalism.com/survey/2022/) that’s open through December 31, and available to take in English, Spanish, Arabic and Italian.

**Worth a read:**



* [The Reuters Institute published its 2022 Digital News Report](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2022), which surveyed 93,000 news consumers around the world. Following decade-long trends, this year's report found a declining interest in news, a rise in news avoidance and fall in trust from last year’s report.
* GIJN compiled a list of [the top 10 data journalism projects of the year](https://gijn.org/2022/12/09/editors-pick-top-10-data-journalism-projects-from-2022/), including topics like [Russian influence networks](https://texty.org.ua/projects/108323/germs-russian-world-who-supports-russia-europe/), [gender disparities in news coverage](https://pudding.cool/2022/02/women-in-headlines/), and the [political polarization of COVID-19 vaccination rates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv0dQfRRrEQ).
* Several media organizations in the US [have been participating in open-ended strikes and one-day walkouts](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2022/unions-back-to-using-walkouts-as-a-bargaining-tactic-after-a-two-decade-break/) over the past two years. This is the most labor unrest the industry has experienced in decades.
