Starting this week, it’s becoming a part of the [Associated Press’ StoryShare program](https://www.ap.org/content/ap-storyshare). Any news org with media insurance can contribute or republish articles from the site. Find out [more on how the program works](https://www.ap.org/content/ap-storyshare).

Now, there’s [more nuance on writing stories that cite preprints](https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/11/how-the-covid-19-pandemic-pushed-preprint-based-journalism-into-the-mainstream/).
* Several journalism orgs are partnering up to offer [a free online training for safety and security in investigative journalism](https://gijn.org/2022/11/08/investigative-journalism-safety-and-security-for-asian-journalists-a-free-training-program/), with part of the training focused on the Asia-Pacific region. The course will take place each Tuesday over 6 weeks starting in February, and [you can register to attend here](https://airtable.com/shrCCcxGjn6Vq1KdF).
