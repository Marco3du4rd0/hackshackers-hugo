**Happening this week:**



* Taipei is holding a conversation on [working for international media outlets](http://hackshackers.taipei/events/latest/)

**Worth a read:**



* Fifteen media outlets participated in [a seven month Google News Initiative/Institute for Nonprofit News collaboration](https://inn.org/news/shaking-the-trees-how-15-newsrooms-grew-sponsorship-revenue-by-250/) to modify business strategies, and the participating outlets grew their revenues by 32% in advertising, 250% in sponsorship and 1485% in events.
* When aggregating data in an effort to point out trends and make it easier to understand, we can sometimes lose important context. [This Stack Overflow blogpost](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/03/03/stop-aggregating-away-the-signal-in-your-data/) talks about ways to incorporate complex data in a visualization to not lose the signal from the noise.
* The OCCRP created some tips for [tracking Russian-owned assets around the world](https://gijn.org/2022/03/17/10-tips-for-tracking-russian-owned-assets/) to see how far the reach of Russian oligarchs go.
