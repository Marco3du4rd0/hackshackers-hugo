The Google News Initiative and Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism are partnering to create [The Data-Driven Reporting Project](https://datadrivenreporting.medill.northwestern.edu/) which offers financial and training support for journalists working on document-based investigative projects.

The $2 million fund is open to support projects that serve local and/or underrepresented communities in the US and Canada, and [the deadline to apply is April 8.](https://datadrivenreporting.medill.northwestern.edu/how-to-apply)

**Worth a read:**



* A report from Montclair State University looks at the effects of [projects where news organizations collaborated with outside organization](https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/03/journalists-are-increasingly-partnering-with-outside-organizations-a-new-report-offers-a-glimpse-at-how-thats-going/)s, and found that they can widen audiences and bring about more impact, especially in topics like government corruption, environment and social justice.
* Poynter made a list of [nine ways to fix and learn from corrections](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2022/how-to-make-correction-tips-journalism/) on articles, and how to have more empathy for yourself and your colleagues when receiving corrections.
* When scrolling through your Twitter feed, you may notice that most of the tweets that show up aren’t from anyone you follow. A Nightingale writer [did an analysis of his Twitter feed](https://nightingaledvs.com/does-twitters-algorithm-hate-your-friends/) to find out more about how Twitter’s algorithm works.
