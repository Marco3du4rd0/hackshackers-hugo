Welcome back, hacks and hackers! The [Global Media Forum](https://gmf.dw.com) is happening this week in a hybrid format - meaning both online and in person.

{{< tweet 1402957716889358338 >}}

It's one of the first journalism/tech-related conferences to meet in person since [NICAR 2020](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2020/). Most attendees will be online, although [you can attend in person](https://www.dw.com/en/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-dw-global-media-forum/a-19118547) in Bonn, Germany. Registration is free and open now.

**Worth a read:**



*   With all the tragedy from the past year, it’s been integral for journalists to find ways to humanize data and trends so that they’re impactful. One way to accomplish that is by [starting with a data-centric hypothesis](https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/hypothesis-data-journalism) that you can then build a story around.
*   Companies around the world are quickly integrating AI into their services, [while scientists are still working to understand AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/20/1025135/ai-large-language-models-bigscience-project/) and how it affects society.
*   Most reporters nowadays are expected to be able to incorporate data into their reporting, and many stories will [rely on one primary data source to base reporting on](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/do-journalists-hide-behind-sources-when-they-use-numbers-in-the-news/), which can lead to credibility issues and accusations of “hiding behind” numbers.
