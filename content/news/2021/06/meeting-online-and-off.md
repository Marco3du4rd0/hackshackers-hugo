Hello, hacks and hackers! While some parts of the world are beginning to meet in person again, many are not, and Hacks/Hackers wants to encourage everyone to meet and greet safely.

{{< tweet 1396329965835141123 >}}

If you are an organizer of a local Hacks/Hackers group, please get in touch about using our paid Zoom account! It can accommodate up to 500 attendees without a time limit.

*   The Knight Foundation [compiled a guide for news publishers](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/a-guide-to-resources-for-local-news-publishers-of-color/) to better collaborate with communities of color through grants, organizations, trainings and fellowships.
*   Twitter launched [a new premium service called Twitter Blue](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/06/is-twitter-blue-a-good-enough-product-to-earn-your-3-a-month/) in Australia and Canada that costs $3 a month and adds features like an undo button, folders for bookmarks and more. Still no edit button, though.
