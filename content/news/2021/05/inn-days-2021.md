Hello, hacks and hackers! The Institute for Nonprofit News has announced their free, virtual [INN Days conference](https://inn.org/about/our-work/inn-days/) is happening June 9th and 10th this year to talk about the future of nonprofit journalism.

They also just released [their first-ever impact report](https://inn.org/about/our-impact/) that shows how within 10 years, independent, nonprofit newsrooms will produce a significant share of the civic news that Americans consume. 

**Worth a read:**



*   Quote This Woman+ is a South African nonprofit that [aggregates a database of women and LGBTQIA identifying source experts](https://quotethiswoman.org.za/) in topics ranging from vaccines to tech to social justice in an effort to increase the diversity in sources. 
*   US states love to display their public data in wildly different formats. [This blogpost](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/states-scraping-automation/) looks at how to more efficiently automate extraction for datasets from six different states.
*   Incorporating data into radio journalism can be a daunting task, so [GIJN compiled tips and tools to make it easier](https://gijn.org/2021/05/27/12-tips-to-make-data-come-alive-in-radio-reporting/) to translate numbers into spoken words.
