We have news, hacks and hackers! Earlier this year, H/H helped organize a series of conversations on the surfacing of local news, with the Credibility Coalition and the Nieman Foundation at Harvard. The discussion included journalists from a variety of outlets, most of them local news, and representatives of several major tech platforms.

You can read about the results in "[An Introduction to Schemas for Journalists](https://credibilitycoalition.org/an-introduction-to-schemas-for-journalists/)," written by Hacks/Hackers' Samantha Sunne, and "[Bridging the Divide Between Local News and Online Platforms](https://credibilitycoalition.org/bridging-the-divide-between-local-news-and-online-platforms/)" by Michael Blanding. Both papers are available for download on the [Credibility Coalition website](https://credibilitycoalition.org/research/).
