**Worth a read:**



* Understanding "light news readers" and tailoring content for them can be difficult, since newsroom staff tend to be heavy news consumers themselves. But [a new report from the International News Media Association](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/10/how-news-publishers-are-turning-casual-infrequent-readers-into-paying-subscribers/) found that doing so is both possible and profitable.
* Speaking of subscriptions, the New York Times gained almost 1 million with [a small, compact version](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2021/meet-the-mini-the-little-puzzle-that-helped-launch-930000-subscriptions-to-new-york-times-games/) of their usual crossword puzzle.
* A Facebook whistleblower made waves this week in the U.S. Congress. Axios put together [a detailed list of the many former Facebook employees](https://www.axios.com/facebook-list-insiders-turned-critics-c0158099-effa-45cf-b0a9-bae6be6097a3.html) who have started sharing tell-alls on the social media giant.
