Welcome to March, hacks and hackers! H/H London [recently announced](https://medium.com/hacks-hackers-london/hacks-hackers-london-embraces-the-opennews-rider-for-meaningfully-inclusive-events-3dc1b12753ed) its goals for adopting the [OpenNews speaker rider](https://opennews.org/projects/speaker-rider/).

The rider is meant to improve diversity and inclusivity at speaking events, and you can read [more about it here](https://opennews.org/projects/speaker-rider/).

**Happening this week:**



*   London is talking about [collaboration between reporters and devs](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hackshackers-london-march-2021-meetup-tickets-135853011013?aff=ebdsoporgprofile)

**Worth a read:**



*   Researchers [trained a neural network called DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) to be able to generate images from strings of text, from generating photo-like storefronts with specific names or illustrating new concepts like a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog.
*   Clubhouse is a new invite-only, iPhone-exclusive social media app that runs on [chatrooms with users streaming audio in real time](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/02/buzzy-social-audio-apps-like-clubhouse-tap-into-the-age-old-appeal-of-the-human-voice/). It's been the focus of a lot of attention due to its interface, diversity opportunities and controversy.
*   When you say something bad about cats to a cat-lover, it often makes their stance as a cat-lover stronger rather than making them consider an alternate view. [This “radical dots simulator”](https://medium.com/nightingale/radical-dots-simulator-visualizing-extreme-belief-formation-91cd6cc29828) explores that concept more broadly in a neat, data-viz-infused way.
