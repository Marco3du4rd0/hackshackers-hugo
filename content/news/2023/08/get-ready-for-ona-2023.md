The [Online News Association](https://journalists.org/)'s [ONA Conference](https://ona23.journalists.org/) is taking place later this month, from August 23-26th, in Philadelphia. The ONA site contains fun resources like [a guide to convince your boss](https://ona23.journalists.org/2023/05/16/5-steps-to-convince-your-boss-you-cant-afford-to-miss-ona23/) to let you attend and [tips for first-time attendees.](https://ona23.journalists.org/first-time-attendee/)

The organization is also sponsoring [a resume drop](https://ona23.journalists.org/resume-drop/) where journalists can submit a resume for recruiters to review. Anyone can turn in a resume, including non-attendees. 

**Worth a Read:**



* A study evaluating [the impact of Google News Initiative grants](https://gijn.org/2023/07/27/google-news-initiative-grants-africa-middle-east-mixed-results/) in Africa and the Middle East found that many projects resulted in "minimum viable products" due to challenges faced by newsrooms in these regions, including a lack of technical expertise, high hiring costs and reliance on third-party vendors
* Two professors did a study [comparing New York Times headlines from the wars in Yemen and Ukraine](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/08/in-news-headlines-some-civilian-casualties-are-more-valuable-than-others/), and found a bias that emphasizes Ukraine's crisis due to U.S. interests, while Yemen's suffering caused by the Saudi-led coalition is downplayed and obscured.
* Poynter talked with local newsrooms to see [how they’re using AI in their newsrooms](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2023/how-some-local-newsrooms-are-using-ai/), and they’re experimenting with automating tasks like scanning for typos, summarizing stories and analyzing tone among others.
