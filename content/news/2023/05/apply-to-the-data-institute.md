**Worth a read:**



* The Institute for Nonprofit News launched a new website called [RuralNewsNetwork.org](https://ruralnewsnetwork.org/). It spotlights reporting from rural communities in the US, and journalists [can submit articles](https://inn.org/news/institute-for-nonprofit-news-launches-ruralnewsnetwork-org/) to be included.
* At Google’s I/O Conference, it [announced changes to its search function](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/05/google-is-changing-up-search-what-does-that-mean-for-news-publishers/), including the use of AI. The AI function will now generate answers that will cite a few sources, but might significantly decrease traffic to news sites.
* [The Messenger](https://themessenger.com/) is a new news website that launched on May 15 and hopes to become a trusted, non-partisan source of news, bringing several news veterans in as section editors.
