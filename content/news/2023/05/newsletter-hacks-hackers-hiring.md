* "Generative" AI, the tools that write text, are creating a lot of media buzz, but there are many (many) more potential uses for the technology. IJNet wrote a [list of helpful non-generative tools](https://ijnet.org/en/story/non-writing-ai-tools-every-journalist-should-know-about) including tagging and text-to-speech functions.
* On another side of the AI frontier, the US Federal Trade Commission, which regulates advertising, [published a blog post](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/05/luring-test-ai-engineering-consumer-trust) outlining some steps in how the agency might end up regulating AI. "Any generative AI output should distinguish clearly between what is organic and what is paid."

It recently [ended its standalone mobile app](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/08/linkedin-layoffs/), and earlier closed its China service, citing tough compliance requirements and very difficult competition.
