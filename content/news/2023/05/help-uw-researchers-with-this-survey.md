The [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), which often partners with us at H/H, is seeking experts in communication and misinformation response to understand how they would choose different response strategies given different conversation contexts on social media.

[To fill out the screener survey, click here](https://forms.gle/eMimDhaBQ4ycHEtZ9). If selected, you would be asked to complete another 15-20 minute online survey and be rewarded with a $30 gift card. If you have questions about it, please contact rzhong98@uw.edu.

* Earlier this year, [a US court case](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23723923-hachette-v-internet-archive-ruling) determined that the Internet Archive’s “Open Library” lending program violates copyright, which sparks a debate on the rights of archivists and the accessibility of open data. [Nightingale wrote a bit about the case](https://nightingaledvs.com/hachette-v-internet-archive-data-access/) and how the Internet Archive is working to appeal the decision.
