This week, the [European Journalism Centre](https://ejc.net/) is hosting a [News Impact Summit](https://ejc.net/events/news-impact-summit-elevating-climate-journalism) on climate journalism. The in-person conference in Lisbon will also announce the winner of the Climate Journalism Award.

Also, this weekend [Investigative Reporters and Editors](https://www.ire.org/) is hosting [AccessFest](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/accessfest-2023/), an online conference on belonging, equity, and inclusion in newsrooms. AccessFest is entirely online and includes sessions on dataviz, data analysis and online tools.
