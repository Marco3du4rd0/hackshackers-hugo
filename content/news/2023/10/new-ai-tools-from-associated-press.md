As part of its Local News AI initiative, the Associated Press is offering [five free "AI-powered products,"](https://blog.ap.org/introducing-5-ai-solutions-for-local-news) including automated safety incidents, weather alert translation, video transcription, email pitch sorting, and public meeting transcript creation. 

Theyâ€™re hosting a webinar on Oct. 26 to show how to use the tools, and [you can register to attend here](https://ap.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_v1T54MtvRnO2OYmxpjOeIw#/registration). You can also answer [a short survey](https://www.research.net/r/ap-local-ai-projects?source=email20231010) on which of these tools would most benefit your newsroom.

**Worth a Read:**



* The [Reynolds Journalism Institute](https://rjionline.org/) is conducting an [anonymous survey](https://surveys.smithgeiger.com/survey/selfserve/bec/231006) to see what could help prevent professional burnout. The survey is open to current journalists, former journalists, students and educators.
* NPR left Twitter/X recently due to problems including poor moderation, policy changes, and reduced engagement. But the exit had minimal impact on traffic, the outlet reported, suggesting [Twitter's diminishing importance for publishers](https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/). 
* People trust individual doctors more than they trust the institution of healthcare overall,  due to expertise and personalized communication. Nieman Lab suggests [journalists could take a similar approach](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/10/peoples-mistrust-of-doctors-can-help-us-understand-their-mistrust-of-journalists/) of balancing expertise with personal engagement to rebuild trust in the news industry.
