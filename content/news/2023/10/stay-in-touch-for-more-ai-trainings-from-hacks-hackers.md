The Knight Center had a fantastic turnout for its course "[How to use ChatGPT and other generative AI tools in your newsroom](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/knight-center-to-offer-free-online-course-on-using-chatgpt-in-the-newsroom-registration-opens-in-september/)." The MOOC featured Hacks/Hackers AI researcher-in-residence Sil Hamilton, as well as the Associated Press's Aimee Rineheart.

The four-week course concluded this week. As AI becomes more and more embedded into newsrooms, Hacks/Hackers looks forward to finding ways to contribute to the discussion and spread the knowledge. Keep an eye out for more updates!
