The famous [Buenos Aires Media Party](https://mediaparty.org/home-en) is here! This year, the conference will focus a lot on AI, especially the ethics, security, and privacy surrounding it. If you're not in Argentina, you can keep an eye out for the #MediaParty hashtag on social media.

The [Knight Center's class on generative AI](https://journalismcourses.org/course/how-to-use-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-tools-in-your-newsrooms/) has started strong, with [nearly 8,000 people signed up](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/7000-students-for-free-online-course/) from almost 150 countries. The online course, featuring Hacks/Hackers AI researcher-in-residence Sil Hamilton, started last week. But it's not too late to join - you can still [sign up on the Knight Center website](https://journalismcourses.org/course/how-to-use-chatgpt-and-other-generative-ai-tools-in-your-newsrooms/).
