Media Party has been a benchmark for digital media innovation since it began in 2012, facilitating the intersection between technology, journalism and storytelling – and the weird people who live between all these spaces. We are a bridge between industries to improve the quality of information, and with it the quality of democracy. From its roots in Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires, Media Party is working in partnership with the broader Hacks/Hackers organization to stage a series of events around the globe.

The Chicago event will follow a similar format as the original, bringing together entrepreneurs, journalists, developers and designers over three days. The event includes keynotes, a media fair, workshops, short talks and a hackathon – each attendee can choose their own adventure. For this year, the themes we are focusing on are synthetic media, ethics in artificial intelligence, misinformation and privacy. 

Media Party facilitates the intersection between these worlds with hands-on spaces to create solutions on informing people to make better decisions. 

Better networks, better information, better democracies.
