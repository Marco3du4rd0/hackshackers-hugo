The Online News Association is [holding an online event](https://journalists.org/event/meetup-a-practical-newsroom-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/) with the Associated Press's Local News AI team.

The 90-minute meetup will feature success stories from local news outlets using artificial intelligence and a panel from experts. It is free for ONA members and $25 for nonmembers.

* Last week, Canada passed a law that would require online platforms to pay for showing links to [news articles from Canadian outlets to Canadian citizens](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/google-meta-could-pull-news-over-bill-c-18-what-the-fallout-may-mean-for-canadians-1.6463185), prompting Meta and Google to respond by pulling Canadian news from their sites altogether.
