**Worth a read:**



* Elon Musk rolled out another [large, sudden change](https://thegrio.com/2023/07/24/x-logo-replaces-twitters-blue-bird-so-we-re-x-instead-of-retweet/) to the Twitter platform. On the desktop version, the logo is now "X", and Musk announced tweets would now be called "Xs."
* Meta, the company that owns Facebook, launched [a direct competitor](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/what-is-instagrams-threads-app-all-your-questions-answered/) to Twitter called Threads. It operates from a user's Instagram account and is currently unavailable in the EU due to privacy concerns. 
* "Reader regularity" is one of the biggest factors in enticing readers to paid subscribers, [a recent study](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2023/news-organization-pageviews-time-spent-wrong-metrics/) from Northwestern University's Medill school found. This means focusing on readers' habits in coming back to sites again and again, as opposed to other metrics like pageviews.
