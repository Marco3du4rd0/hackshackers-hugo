After the success of the first AI course, the Knight Center is arranging a [second online course](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/registration-now-open-for-generative-ai-course/), called "Generative AI for journalists: Discovering what data can do."

The course is led by Sil Hamilton, Hacks/Hackers' AI researcher at large, and will focus on developing and implementing AI applications into your workflow. The course runs from mid-November to mid-December, and the [$95 registration fee](https://journalismcourses.org/course/generative-ai-for-journalists-boc/) offers a more advanced curriculum for a more limited number of students. A certificate of completion is included.

**Worth a Read:**



* The Partnership on AI, which Hacks/Hackers is a member of, recently released their [AI Adoption for Newsrooms](https://partnershiponai.org/ai-for-newsrooms/) guide. The guide offers a new 10 step process based on PAI's already existing [five principles](https://medium.com/partnership-on-ai/local-newsrooms-should-adopt-ai-ethics-as-they-adopt-ai-5-recommendations-ee1496ea211e) for AI adoption.
* Media Matters, a nonprofit reporting on the media industry, has been served with a [lawsuit from Elon Musk](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970274/x-elon-musk-media-matters-lawsuit-nazi-ads-filed) for a story about X's advertising choices. Musk's suit claims the outlet manipulated the platform's algorithm, but doesn't deny the story's claims outright.
* More than half of the counties in the US now have a [single news outlet](https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2023/2023-news-deserts-report-penny-abernathy-medill/), if they have one at all, according to a new report by the Medill School. In 2023, local newspapers either closed or merged with other outlets at a rate of more than one a week.
