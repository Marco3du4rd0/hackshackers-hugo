Hacks/Hackers is [offering micro-grants of up to $10,000](https://www.hackshackers.com/news/2023/11/call-for-proposals-improving-information-credibility-with-tech/) to individuals and organizations who want to research or test new tech tools that can advance global credibility in journalism. 

The ideal projects will address misinformation issues, involve innovative uses of technology and help working journalists. Applicants must be willing to share their results publicly. Hacks/Hackers is hoping to select 2-4 projects. The deadline to apply is January 31, 2024, but early applications are encouraged.
