Philip Meyer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning  reporter who pioneered incorporating data analysis into investigative journalism, died at the age of 93. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/business/media/philip-meyer-dead.html) and [Detroit Free Press](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2023/11/08/phil-meyer-data-journalist-dies/71508032007/), where he worked when he won a Pulitzer Prize, both wrote obituaries to honor his legacy.

He wrote a book titled “[Precision Journalism: A Reporter’s Introduction to Social Science Methods](https://books.google.com/books/about/Precision_Journalism.html?id=1YB4AAAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description)” in 1973, which has had multiple updated editions since. His legacy is also honored in [IRE’s Philip Meyer Journalism Award](https://www.ire.org/awards/philip-meyer-journalism-award-faq/), started in 2005, that “recognizes excellent journalism done using social science research methods.”
