Applications are now open for the [2023-2024 AI Accountability Fellowships](https://pulitzercenter.org/grants-fellowships/opportunities-journalists/ai-accountability-fellowships), hosted by The AI Accountability Network at The Pulitzer Center!

The fellowships are open to journalists around the world, and 10 fellows will be chosen to pursue an AI-related reporting project over 10 months. Fellows receive up to $20,000 to support their projects, and the deadline to apply is July 1.
