The Oxford [Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/) published its annual [Digital News Report](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2023) last week, which interviewed 93,000 respondents from 46 markets across the globe to learn more on how audiences are consuming news. 

To read highlights from the report, [RISJ created a Twitter thread here](https://twitter.com/risj_oxford/status/1668764164691738624) with data and takeaways from the study.

**Worth a read:**



* Many younger people are turning to TikTok for their news. Reuters wrote about how [content creators can monetize their news content on TikTok](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/news-junkies-turn-tiktok-chart-new-paths-media-2023-06-15/) while job security at most major media orgs is dwindling.
* Marcelo Duhalde, Associate Creative Director of South China Morning Post, has won a myriad of awards for his work in infographics. [In this interview](https://nightingaledvs.com/marcelo-duhaldes-graphics-bring-journalistic-investigations-to-life/), he shares how his newsroom has prioritized infographics, the process that goes into creating them and more.
* The New Yorker writes on [the rise and fall of data-driven political journalism](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-was-nate-silvers-data-revolution) with an emphasis on Nate Silver and his site FiveThirtyEight, for its use of statistical models to predict election outcomes.
