* The Africa Data Hub created several different publicly available [online courses](https://www.africadatahub.org/training) to teach data journalism fundamentals, including topics like [a beginner’s guide to creating maps](https://www.africadatahub.org/training-modules/visualisation-beginners-guide-to-maps), [an introduction to “interviewing” data](https://www.africadatahub.org/training-modules/spreadsheets-how-to-interview-data) and more!
* Journalists in Karachi, Pakistan[ used Google Earth maps and alternative data sources](https://gijn.org/2023/05/30/karachi-investigate-journalism-cities-maps-data/) (like NGOs, academics, think tanks and government officials) to report on systemic municipal issues when they couldn’t access adequate public records.
* In a new essay published on Nightingale called, “[Data Visualization: A Subjective Lens on Reality](https://nightingaledvs.com/data-visualization-a-subjective-lens-on-reality/),” the author notes that data is a human construction rather than an objective truth. They then propose guidelines for designers to critically engage with data and prioritize transparency when making data visualizations.
