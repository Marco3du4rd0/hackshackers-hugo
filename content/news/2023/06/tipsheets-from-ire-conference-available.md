The annual [Investigative Reporters & Editors Conference](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/) happened last week in Orlando, Florida. As always, IRE uploaded many of the sessions' [tipsheets and audio recordings](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/ire-2023/ire23-tipsheets-audio/) on their website.

They also announced [the winners of the 2022 IRE Awards](https://www.ire.org/2022-ire-award-winners/), which recognize “the most outstanding watchdog journalism of the year.” Winners this year include the BBC, Al Jazeera, the Associated Press and the OCCRP.

* [A study in Norway](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2023.2196584) found that many young people prefer free news options or use strategies like borrowing logins or relying on social media for access because they find subscriptions inconvenient. Non-subscribers still seek news, but find subscriptions burdensome and prefer accessing news from multiple sources.
* [The 2023 Digital News Report from the Reuters Institute](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2023) found that news organizations are trying to find ways to deliver better content by combining algorithms and editorial approaches, but [audiences are skeptical of both AI and human editors](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/06/people-dont-want-robots-picking-their-headlines-but-they-dont-really-want-editors-doing-it-either/) in charge of news selection.
