The [Press Forward fund](https://www.pressforward.news/), a $500 million investment over five years, aims to bolster the structure of local news in the US. The coalition [is led by the MacArthur Foundation](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/09/can-500-million-over-five-years-revitalize-local-news-22-funders-team-up-to-try/) and includes projects like the Tech Sustainability Initiative and the Tiny News Collective.

A group of journalism organizations, including the National Association of Black Journalists, the Online News Association, and OpenNews, [issued an open letter](https://mije.org/news/2023/09/19/press-forward-open-letter-equity-funding.html) to Press Forward, asking the coalition to prioritize equitable distribution of the fund to underrepresented voices.
