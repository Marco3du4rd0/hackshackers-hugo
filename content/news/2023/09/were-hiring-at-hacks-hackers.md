Hacks/Hackers is hiring for two positions related to our NSF-funded [Analysis and Response for Toolkit for Trust (ARTT) project](https://www.artt.cs.washington.edu/):



* [A Researcher](https://www.hackshackers.com/news/2023/08/hacks-hackers-hiring-a-researcher/) to conduct research, coordinate efforts and contribute to the creation of related materials.
* A [Community Coordinator](https://www.hackshackers.com/news/2023/08/hacks-hackers-seeks-community-coordinator/) to shape and maintain a supportive user community, and ensure the success of the expert-informed software tool aimed at addressing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation.

Both jobs are remote, but applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S. Applications are being reviewed now, and the ARTT team is looking to fill these positions by the end of September.
