The Associated Press is conducting [an anonymous survey](https://www.research.net/r/AP-Gen-AI) on how the news industry approaches AI, with an emphasis on professional and ethical practices around generative AI, like ChatGPT and Midjourney.

The survey will be open through the month and take about 25-30 minutes to complete. Results will be published next year, but have published [a report on results from its 2021 survey](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363475725_Artificial_Intelligence_in_Local_News_A_survey_of_US_newsrooms%27_AI_readiness) on AI in local newsrooms.
