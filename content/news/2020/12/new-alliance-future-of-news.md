Hello, hacks and hackers! The [News Product Alliance](https://newsproduct.org), in conjunction with [OpenNews](https://opennews.org/), has announced a new event for the intersection of product thinkers and news producers.

{{< tweet 1339239218925744129 >}}

The inaugural [News Product Alliance Summit](https://newsproduct.org) will take place online next March, after [NICAR](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/), the [Knight Media Forum](https://mailchi.mp/knightfoundation/news-and-updates-from-knight-foundation-911zm2i9qe-848606?e=803088a103) and [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/).

**Worth a read:**



*   The NewsQ Initiative brought together journalists, media scholars and platform technologists on panels [to discuss the algorithmic processes](https://newsq.net/newsq-review-panel-reports-2020/) that decide which news articles to prioritize online.
*   This year, journalists unearthed several problematic [consequences from algorithm-driven decision making](https://themarkup.org/2020-in-review/2020/12/15/algorithms-bias-racism-surveillance), like Google automatically connecting searches for Black, Asian and Latina girls to porn and police choosing who to search based on arbitrary traits decided by police analysts.
*   A U.S. Supreme Court case could make web scraping illegal, so The Markup wrote a court brief explaining how [web scraping is vital to data/investigative journalism](https://gijn.org/2020/12/17/why-web-scraping-is-vital-to-democracy/), and therefore vital to democracy.
