Check out the Job Postings section of this newsletter, where we share new positions every week.

**The week ahead:**



*   Dar es Salaam is talking about [the importance of mobile journalism](https://www.facebook.com/events/423812885600597/)
*   Kampala is learning [how to clean data with OpenRefine](https://www.facebook.com/events/3751173921617675/)

**Worth a read:**



*   Archiving tweets, photos and videos posted during a breaking news scenario can get overwhelming. GIJN talked to Bellingcat journalists to find out what [open source tools they used to document social media posts](https://gijn.org/2021/01/15/how-open-source-experts-identified-the-us-capitol-rioters/) from the U.S. Capitol riot.

*   We’ve been covering the pandemic for almost a year now and it doesn’t seem to be letting up anytime soon, so [remember to take care of yourself](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/six-self-care-tips-for-journalists-to-prevent-pandemic-burnout/s2/a785056/) — whether it’s getting involved in communities that help you feel supported or adding happy accounts to your social media feed.
