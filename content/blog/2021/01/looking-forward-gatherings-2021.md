Happy Sunday, hacks and hackers! Now that we are fully in to 2021, we are looking ahead to events like [NICAR](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/), [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/) and the [Computation + Journalism Symposium](https://cj2020.northeastern.edu/).

So far, all events have been scheduled online. If you know of any events your fellow hacks and hackers would appreciate, please let us know.

**Worth a read:**



*   The charts, graphs and other ways of [quantifying grief](https://medium.com/nightingale/data-visualization-as-grief-599dc6536e6f) may lead to a lack of connection to what those numbers represent, so visualizing the impact of the pandemic in an empathetic way could help us from becoming too disconnected.
*   GIJN asked investigative editors from around the world about [the topics they’ll be focusing on this year](https://gijn.org/2021/01/28/investigations-2021-from-vaccines-and-climate-change-to-surveillance-and-the-far-right/), including the ongoing threat to democracy, growing inequality and increases in surveillance.
*   The [enduring allure of conspiracy theories](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/01/the-enduring-allure-of-conspiracies/) is so strong that psychologists say that it’s near impossible for people who believe in them to stop. Some organizations are pivoting to try to prevent them from ever spreading.
