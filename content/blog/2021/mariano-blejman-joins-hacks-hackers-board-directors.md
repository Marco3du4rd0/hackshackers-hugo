**Worth a read:**



*   Investigating social media posts can be overwhelming with so many platforms to dig through. GIJN compiled a list of [tools that reporters use to track user generated content](https://gijn.org/2021/01/11/gijn-toolbox-crowdtangle-echosec-and-searching-social-media/).
*   As the COVID-19 vaccine rolls out during a time of social unrest and media distrust, it is vital [to cover the vaccination effort ethically and carefully](https://www.poynter.org/ethics-trust/2021/the-media-needs-to-get-the-vaccination-story-right/) without bias and sensationalizing. 
*   The Solutions Journalism Network published an essay where they asked experts [how best to cover conflict without amplifying it](https://thewholestory.solutionsjournalism.org/complicating-the-narratives-b91ea06ddf63). Some tips include adding complexity in opinions, and highlighting facts, over debunking misinformative statements.
