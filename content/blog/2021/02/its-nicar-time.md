It's here, hacks and hackers! One of our favorite conferences, [NICAR](https://nicar21.pathable.co), is happening online this week.

This is the first time the conference has ever been fully online, so this is your chance to brush up on topics like Excel, R and data story editing.

**Happening this week:**



*   Nairobi is [learning Python](https://www.facebook.com/events/2655776844644765/) techniques

**Worth a read:**



*   Using [open source data is integral to investigative journalism](https://gijn.org/2021/02/17/amnesty-internationals-sam-dubberley-on-digital-verification-and-human-rights/), but with the volume of information available, it’s important to make sure that sharing it is accurate, safe and ethical, especially when reporting on human rights.
*   Being able to translate huge numbers, like [the coronavirus death toll](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/how-does-covid-19s-toll-compare-with-heart-disease-cancer-and-other-causes-of-death/), into empathy-inducing visualizations that reach the masses is a superpower [that has inspired action throughout history](https://medium.com/nightingale/feeling-scale-is-necessary-to-inspire-action-b894b1ba5d41). 
*   Facebook has been fighting regulation in Australia and recently banned news sites altogether. Unfortunately, NiemanLab writes, it [seems to have worked](https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/02/facebook-got-everything-it-wanted-out-of-australia-by-being-willing-to-do-what-the-other-guy-wouldnt/).
