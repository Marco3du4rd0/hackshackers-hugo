If you'd like to join in on the fun, the event will be livestreamed. Follow [H/H Taipei on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hackshackersTPE) for the link.

**The week ahead:**



*   Taipei is [marking four years](http://hackshackers.taipei/events/latest/)

**Worth a read:**



*   Data discovery platforms are becoming more popular among companies with vast amounts of data to organize. A data scientist at Amazon took a look at [what features some of the most notable platforms have](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/data-discovery-platforms/), and how they compare to others.
*   A study from the Knight Foundation, as part of their ongoing series on [Trust, Media and Democracy](https://knightfoundation.org/topics/trust-media-and-democracy/), asked Americans [how well they thought the media covered the 2020 election](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/in-election-2020-how-did-the-media-electoral-process-fare-republicans-democrats-disagree/). More than four in five adults believe they were exposed to misinformation during election season.
*   With the countdown to vaccine distributions on the horizon, it’s important to [ask drug companies the right questions](https://gijn.org/2020/12/10/the-problem-with-current-vaccine-trials-what-journalists-need-to-be-asking-drug-companies/) to best inform the public, like how effective they’ll be over time and whether or not they reduce transmission.
