So you want to start a Hacks/Hackers chapter in your town? Welcome! To start a group under the Hacks/Hackers banner, we just have a few rules:

1. Your primary goal must be to foster connections journalists (the “hacks”) and technologists (the “hackers”) to rethink the future of news and information. You can read more about Hacks/Hackers’ goals **[here][1]**.
2. You must abide by the **[Hacks/Hackers Charter][2]** on respect, responsibility and collaboration.
3. There can only be one group per city. You can check the current chapters **[here][3]**.
4. At least one of the group leaders needs to join the **[Organizers email list][4]**. Introduce yourselves! If you’re interested, we can hook you up with a mentor &#8211; another organizer &#8211; to help you get started.

If you’ve got those fundamentals down, there are a few more that aren’t strictly necessary, but we STRONGLY suggest:

1. Meet at least once per month or quarter.
2. Have more than one co-organizer. (It’s going to be more work than you think!)
3. Commit at least several hours per month to arrange talks, hackathons, happy hours or other meetups. You can check out the **[newsletter][5]** to see what kind of events other groups are doing.
4. Have representatives from both the journalism sector (reporters, editors, publishers, developers, etc.) and the technology sector (coders, engineers, designers, developers, etc.).
5. Connect with other H/H organizers via the **[email list][4]**, mentor system, **[Slack channel][6]** (email **[Dan][7]** for an invite), **[GitHub][8]** or other means. They’re a great sounding board for problems, proposals or anything else you might need to sound out.

Got all that? Good! Send us a note on the **[organizers email list][4] **and tell us about your first event!
