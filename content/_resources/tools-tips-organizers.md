If you found your way to this page, that means you&#8217;re interested in starting a new chapter or wanting to get more involved. Great! Here you can find a list of resources as well as some crowdsourced tips for organizers.

**If you’re rebooting a chapter or starting a new one&#8230;**

  * Read the [Rules (and suggestions) for New Chapters][1]
  * Ask questions on the [Google Group for organizers][2]
  * Consider holding a [Connect event][3]
  * Start with events every other month, rather than every month (&#8220;Do less better&#8221;)
  * Hold a meeting or retreat just for organizers, to plan a meeting for all members.
  * Email us at <meetup@hackshackers.com>. We’ll set up a Meetup page for you, like [meetupnyc.hackshackers.com][4], though some groups have used Eventbrite and Facebook too.
  * If you need some startup money, let us know. We might have some money (not much) we can funnel to startup chapters, but $50 can go a long way in a bar toward appetizers.

**If you want to get more involved…**

  * The first Tuesday of every month, we hold an [open call][5]
  * Subscribe to [the weekly newsletter][6]
  * Check out the [calendar of all Hacks/Hackers meetups][7] worldwide
  * Join the [Slack channel][8], if you&#8217;re on Slack (get an [invite here][13])

**If you&#8217;re planning an event&#8230;**

  * Hacks/Hackers Africa has a [list of potential meetups][9]
  * Erika Owens in Philadelphia published [a list of suggestions][10] for organizers
  * London shared their template for [organizer roles and responsibilities][11], and [task assignment worksheet][12]
  * Try finding sponsors by making a verbal announcement at your meetup or reaching out to potential sponsors by email
  * Make a venue database for your city, so that you (and future organizers) have a place to find/record potential venues
