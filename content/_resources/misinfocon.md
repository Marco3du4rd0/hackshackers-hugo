[MisinfoCon](misinfocon.com) is a global movement focused on building solutions to online trust, verification, fact checking, and reader experience in the interest of addressing misinformation in all of its forms.

# Summits

It started as a large gathering [at MIT in February 2017](https://misinfocon.com/misinfocon-a-summit-on-misinformation-feb-24-26-at-mit-media-lab-the-nieman-foundation-for-232507bd08a6). That gathering brought together ambassadors from technology platforms, news organizations, as well as experts in social science, media literacy, policy, advocacy, cybersecurity and more. It was a summit, and also a “Creative Studio.” There were talks by people leading initiatives to fight misinformation, discussions bringing together key themes and challenges, and town hall-style conversations that brought the big picture into focus. And there were also demos of tools being developed to help journalists, newsrooms, and readers make better sense of the information around them.

The second in-person gathering was [MisinfoCon at MozFest](https://misinfocon.com/misinfocon-is-back-well-see-you-at-the-mozilla-festival-in-london-fb8ea5f8c42b), Mozilla's open web festival, in London, in October 2017. The event focused on three areas critical to the fight against misinformation: literacy and critical thinking, data and metrics, and global responses to misinformation.
