*This page is an example of the "scratch pad" that any H/H group can have.*

*We commend putting an image up front that represents your group. Here is an example image for Minneapolis.*

Add a few paragraphs explaining about your group here, and any other Content
you feel is relevant.

It's also worth nothing that users can embed many types of multimedia,
including images, tweets, youtube videos, and instagram tweets.

# Embedding Multimedia (Remove this section, added just for reference)

Images can be added from any external source using the following markdown code:

Hugo provides things called shortcodes to make embedding easy.

To embed an Instagram post, first find the URL of the post you'd like to embed.
It will look something like https://www.instagram.com/p/BnEY-fOnnPO/

Then, take the hex code in the last part of the URL (In this case, BnEY-fOnnPO),
and add a code like this -- except, add the curley brackets without spaces -
`{{` and `}}`:

`{ {< instagram BnEY-fOnnPO >} }`


Youtube Videos can also be embedded by using a similar format -- just like above,
add the curley brackets without spaces in between:

`{ {< youtube NCeKSpqvTxE >} }`

Same with Tweets - similarly, add the curley brackets without spaces in between both:

`{ {< twitter 1285431839537213441 >} }`

Finally, users can close with a table that includes past highlights:
