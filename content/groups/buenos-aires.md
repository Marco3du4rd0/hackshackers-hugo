Add a few paragraphs explaining about your group here.

Users can embed many types of multimedia, including images, tweets, youtube videos, and instagram tweets.

# Embedding Multimedia

Images can be added using the following markdown code:
`[Buenos Aires as seen during quarantine in the  the COVID-19 Pandemic ](https://fotos.perfil.com/2020/05/11/trim/1280/720/cuarentena-954460.jpg)`

Hugo provides things called shortcodes to make embedding easy.

To embed an Instagram post, first find the URL of the post you'd like to embed.
It will look something like https://www.instagram.com/p/BnEY-fOnnPO/

Then, take the hex code in the last part of the URL (In this case, BnEY-fOnnPO),
and add a code like this -- except, add the curley brackets without spaces -
`{{` and `}}`:

`{ {< instagram BnEY-fOnnPO >} }`


Youtube Videos can also be embedded by using a similar format -- just like above,
add the curley brackets without spaces in between:

`{ {< youtube NCeKSpqvTxE >} }`

Same with Tweets - similarly, add the curley brackets without spaces in between both:

`{ {< twitter 1285431839537213441 >} }`

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
