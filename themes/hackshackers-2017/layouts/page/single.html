				<p>Good morning, afternoon, <a href="#">evening or night, hacks and hackers.</a> After a year of news events like Brexit, the European refugee crisis and the U.S. election, journalists are getting more concerned about the spread of fake news and an apparent lack of trust from the public. Organizations and private companies are starting to take action, but it‚Äôs going to be a long road ahead.</p>

					<h4>Chapter spotlight:</h4>
					Helsinki met last month to share info about the Uutisraivaaja media innovation contest in Finland. Event organizer Rosa Lampela learned something that may be counterintuitive: sometimes you can have too many speakers.
					‚ÄúEven though the speeches in H/H are supposed to be quite short, a lot of time goes into the questions and discussion. That‚Äôs a good thing as they are the whole point of the meetings. Now I know not to crowd the schedule.‚Äù
